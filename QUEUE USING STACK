232. IMPLEMNT QUEUE USING STACK:

Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).
Implement the MyQueue class:
void push(int x) Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
int pop() Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
int peek() Returns the element at the front of the queue.
boolean empty() Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.
Notes:
You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

Example 1:
Input
["MyQueue", "push", "push", "peek", "pop", "empty"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, 1, false]

Explanation
MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
myQueue.push(1); // queue is: [1]
myQueue.push(2); // queue is: [1, 2] (leftmost is front of the queue)
myQueue.peek(); // return 1
myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is [2]
myQueue.empty(); // return false
"CONSTRAINTS:"
->1 <= x <= 9
->At most 100 calls will be made to push, pop, peek, and empty.
->All the calls to pop and peek are valid.

Intuition:
A queue follows FIFO (First In, First Out), whereas a stack follows LIFO (Last In, First Out).
To implement a queue using stacks, we use the reversing property of stacks.
In your approach, when elements are moved from st1 to st2, their order gets reversed.
This reversal makes the oldest inserted element come to the top of st2, allowing us to correctly perform queue operations.
By transferring elements only during pop() and peek() when required, we efficiently simulate queue behavior.

Approach:
Use two stacks: st1 and st2.
Push:
Always push elements into st1.
This stack maintains the insertion order.

Pop:
If both stacks are empty, the queue is empty.
If st2 is empty, move all elements from st1 to st2.
This reverses the order so the front of the queue comes on top.
Pop the top element from st2, which represents the front of the queue.

Peek:
If the queue is empty, return an invalid value.
If st2 is empty, transfer all elements from st1 to st2.
Return the top of st2 without removing it (front element).

Empty:
The queue is empty only when both st1 and st2 are empty.


Time Complexity:
push(): O(1)
pop(): O(n) (only when elements are transferred)
peek(): O(n) (only when elements are transferred)
empty(): O(1)  


JAVA CODE:
class MyQueue {

    Stack <Integer> st1;
    Stack <Integer> st2;

    public MyQueue() {
        st1 = new Stack<>();
        st2 = new Stack<>();
        
    }
    
    public void push(int x) {
        st1.push(x);   
    }
    
    public int pop() {
        if (empty()) {
            return -1;   // throw exception
        }
         if (st2.isEmpty()) {            //stack 2 is empty.
            while (!st1.isEmpty()) {     //stack 1 is not empty.
                st2.push(st1.pop());     // Take the top element from st1 and push it into st2.
            }
        }
        return st2.pop();
    }

    public int peek() {
        if (empty()) {
            return -1;   
        }
        if (st2.isEmpty()) {           
            while (!st1.isEmpty()) {     
                st2.push(st1.pop());    
            }
        }
        return st2.peek();
    }    
    
    public boolean empty() {
        return st1.isEmpty() && st2.isEmpty();
    }
}
